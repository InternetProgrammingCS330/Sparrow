-- 	"Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) has been used for more than 40 years for measurements of exposure to radiation, 
-- 		including dating applications in fields like geology and archeology. Most importantly, dosimetry has been used 
-- 		retrospectively to assess the exposure to radiation of the victims and survivors of the atomic bombs in Japan and, 
-- 		more recently, the Chernobyl accident. The use of EPR is based on its unique capabilities to measure free radicals. 
-- 		Teeth have traditionally been used for this type of test because this matrix material (especially that of the 
-- 		enamel) stabilizes the free radicals created during exposure to radiation. The amount of free radicals present 
-- 		in the matrix is therefore proportional to the dose of radiation received. Traditionally, tests have been conducted 
-- 		by making measurements on teeth that have been shed due to natural causes or treatment, and then concentrating the 
-- 		enamel material to make the measurements using conventional EPR spectrometers. However, with the advent of new EPR 
-- 		techniques that permit the measurements to be made in living subjects, dosimetry measurements can be conducted in vivo, 
-- 		without removal of the teeth. With this advancement, such technology can be used to help deal with the medical 
-- 		consequences of a nuclear catastrophe when a population of people is exposed to an unknown amount of radiation. 
-- 		In such an event, it is important to be able quickly and reliably to triage people into three categories:

-- 		Group 1: Low radiation exposure and low risk of becoming sick. It is important to define this group (the largest) to help keep the system clear for those actually in need of medical attention (<~2 Gy).
-- 		Group 2: Moderate radiation exposure that carries significant risk but can be treated (~2<~7 Gy).
-- 		Group 3: Those who have received a dose of radiation that is probably too high to respond satisfactorily to medical intervention (>~7Gy).
		
-- 		We have been developing a prototype and a set of clinical trials using this technology over the past 15 years. 
-- 		The need for such a capability is indicated by the fact that this development is being supported by grants from NIH 
-- 		and the Department of Defense. The overall orientation of the research is to develop a device that is transportable 
-- 		and readily operated in the field with sufficient speed and accuracy that large numbers of people can be screened by 
-- 		first responders. The current device focuses on making the measurements in the molar teeth (the large teeth in the back 
-- 		of the mouth). Recent developments have indicated that there may be some significant advantages in making the measurements 
-- 		on the back of the incisors (the front teeth).

-- 		We are looking for help to develop the technical aspects of this new approach. The current process takes ~15 minutes, 
-- 		uses the molar teeth for analysis, and is largely comprised of setup time. It also is limited by the fact that many 
-- 		people have extensive fillings in their molar teeth, making it difficult to find sites where the enamel can be 
-- 		measured. The time required for the measurements could be drastically reduced and allow for a more rapid triage 
-- 		system in the event of an emergency if there existed a method to create and position the resonator loop on the teeth in 
-- 		the front of the mouth (the incisors). The general feasibility of this approach has been demonstrated, but an effective 
-- 		and practical device to make the measurements needs to be developed. The requirements are both in the development of the

-- 	"It goes without saying that classical music is dramatically different from all other musical styles. It may be less obvious to many people, though, that some of those differences are:
-- 		The music is almost always performed purely acoustically, without any amplification whatsoever (except when performing in outdoor venues) and
-- 		The music is often extremely flexible, and the musicians are continuously adjusting to each other (and the conductor) in order to stay together, and
-- 		The music vacillates frequently and rapidly between volume extremes and furthermore often has different instruments playing simultaneously both very loud and very soft.
-- 		In order for the classical music performer to be able to perform at their peak they need to be able to hear well both themselves and their colleagues at all times.
-- 		As the symphony orchestra has evolved over the last 200 years the number of instruments has increased dramatically, and the volume of many of those instruments has also increased. For many orchestral musicians it is now imperative that they wear ear protection if they expect to retain their hearing throughout their career. (The major symphony orchestras have experimented with sound baffles, meant to protect the more downstage musicians from the louder sounds of the more upstage players, with mixed results. There is, however, general agreement that they are unsightly to the audience.)
-- 		Unfortunately, any ear protection yet devised causes a significant loss of clarity of the ambient sounds, often making it difficult or impossible for the musicians to hear themselves. Additionally, the musicians are forced to insert and remove earplugs often during a performance, a distraction to themselves, their colleagues and the audience. The classical musician needs to be able to continue to hear clearly and well, yet have the total volume stay at manageable, non-damaging levels.
-- 		The Intelligent Earplug will enable the performing musician to hear well and clearly at all times by passing through to the ear-canal all safe sounds at a very high level of audio fidelity. For obvious reasons this needs to be accomplished without any noticeable latency. Those sounds that exceed the user-selectable threshold for loudness comfort will be reduced to the threshold level. The Intelligent Earplug will be as small, discrete and comfortable as conventional earplugs in order that its use will be transparent to the concert-going audience. It will operate with its own self-contained power source in order that it not require any wires, even if that means that it will need to be charged between uses.
-- 		Performers on some of the lower volume and lower pitched instruments (e.g. the cellos and basses) often find that they cannot monitor their own sound well at low volume, even when the overall volume of the orchestra is below the threshold for damage. In this situation one is often instinctively tempted to play slightly louder, resulting in a lack of blend within the section.
-- 		The Super-Intelligent Earplug will additionally allow the performer to mix into the ambient sound a small user-controllable amount of his/her own sound. The Super-Intelligent Earplug will add a wireless pickup, discretely mounted on the instrument, with the ability to transmit wirelessly to the Intelligent Earplug. In order that many musicians might simultaneously use this technology, it is important that the wireless transmitter and receiver be paired in a way that they can only communicate with each other.",

The Trak Performance software assists the user in tracking players, one player at a time, by providing a diagram of the field on screen, and recording the user's mouse movements as the user follows the player's movements around the field, watching a separate video. The user can also setup hot keys to hit when various events occur, like a shot.
